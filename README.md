# Rest-Assured Sample Project
This project is a demonstration of my experience creating a testing framework using Java with Cucumber and Rest-Assured libraries for testing RESTful APIs.

###  Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher
Maven

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
- `mvn clean install`

###  Running the Tests
The tests in this project can be run using the following command:
- `mvn test`
This will run the Cucumber scenarios defined in the feature files under the `src/test/resources/features `directory.

### Libraries Used
This project uses the following libraries:

**Cucumber**: A tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that allows you to write specifications in Gherkin format.
**Gherkin**: A business-readable domain-specific language that lets you describe software's behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented.
**Rest-Assured**: A Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for testing RESTful APIs.

### Disclaimer
The libraries and APIs used in this project are used exclusively for practicing purposes, all credits due to their creators.
